Summary: @HMRoff on deceptive AI, @dryellowbean & @jud1ths1mon on ethics, @vdignum, @MullerCatelijne and @RecklessCoding on the EU AI Ethics Whitepaper, @Klonick provokes on the definition of AI, new AI ethics map from @aiethicslab


Welcome to the EI weekly round-up; a curation of quality posts to help you cut through the noise and get right to the heart of the discussion on AI and Tech Ethics.

Every Tuesday we publish a list of links to articles and debates that have happened over the past week in the community, allowing you to stay as up-to-date as possible on developments and facts. We will often link to arguments from all sides of the debate, even if the opinions may be controversial. We would like to mention, however, that EI does not endorse any of the information published, all links are reflections of the author's opinions and not that of Ethical Intelligence.


## First analysis of the EU Whitepaper on AI

"This week, Europe took a clear stance on AI; foster the uptake of AI technologies, underpinned by what it calls ‘an ecosystem of excellence’, while also ensuring their compliance with to European ethical norms, legal requirements and social values, ‘an ecosystem of trust’. While the Whitepaper on AI of the European Commission does not propose legislation yet, it announces some bold legislative measures, that will likely materialize by the end of 2020. "

## AI Deception: When Your Artificial Intelligence Learns to Lie

"Understanding the breadth of what “AI deception” looks like, and what happens when it is not a human’s intent behind a deceptive AI, but instead the AI agent’s own learned behavior. These may seem somewhat far-off concerns, as AI is still relatively narrow in scope and can be rather stupid in some ways. To have some analogue of an “intent” to deceive would be a large step for today’s systems. However, if we are to get ahead of the curve regarding AI deception, we need to have a robust understanding of all the ways AI could deceive. We require some conceptual framework or spectrum of the kinds of deception an AI agent may learn on its own before we can start proposing technological defenses."

## Thinking About ‘Ethics’ in the Ethics of AI

"One of the fundamental questions in the ethics of AI, therefore, can be formulated as a problem of value alignment: how can we build autonomous AI that is aligned with societally held values."

"Our review of the theoretical, technical, and ethical challenges to machine ethics does not intend to be exhaustive or conclusive, and these challenges could indeed be overcome in future research and development of autonomous AI. However, we think that these challenges do warrant a pause and reconsideration of the prospects of building ethical AI. In fact, we want to advance a more fundamental critique of machine ethics before exploring another path for answering the value alignment problem."

## Ethical Dimensions of Using Artificial Intelligence in Health Care

"An artificially intelligent computer program can now diagnose skin cancer more accurately than a board-certified dermatologist.1 Better yet, the program can do it faster and more efficiently, requiring a training data set rather than a decade of expensive and labor-intensive medical education. While it might appear that it is only a matter of time before physicians are rendered obsolete by this type of technology, a closer look at the role this technology can play in the delivery of health care is warranted to appreciate its current strengths, limitations, and ethical complexities."

## Would you rather a human or a black box AI perform surgery on you? Would you want the AI to be illegal?

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1230592238490615816) sparked a wide ranging discussion this week. Some objected to the framing, arguing that the presumption of superior outcomes from the AI smuggled in a lot of assumptions regarding whom, exactly, and in what cases, might expect to benefit. Others argued that the question of illegality is an orthogonal one, and ought not be considered directly alongside a claim to superior performance.

## Forensic Architecture Founder Says United States Prevented His Visit Via Algorithm

"Eyal Weizman, the director of the investigative group, said an embassy official in London told him an algorithm had identified a security threat that was related to him."

“Associative algorithms, triangulating algorithms, that look at patterns that look at relations between actions and movement, between people and places,” he said. “We need to gear up to be able identify and monitor those.”
