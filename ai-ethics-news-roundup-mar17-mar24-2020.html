    <p>Welcome to the EI weekly round-up; a curation of quality posts to help you cut through the noise and get right to the heart of the discussion on AI and Tech Ethics.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday we publish a list of links to articles and debates that have happened over the past week in the community, allowing you to stay as up-to-date as possible on developments and facts. We will often link to arguments from all sides of the debate, even if the opinions may be controversial. We would like to mention, however, that EI does not endorse any of the information published, all links are reflections of the author's opinions and not that of Ethical Intelligence.</p>
<h2>Open Letter: Contact Tracking and NHSX</h2>
<p>"During this global emergency, technology and data-driven decisions have a vital role in saving lives by delivering essential information, building communities and managing capacity across the NHS. But they are not a magic bullet to solve unsolvable problems."</p>
<p>"As responsible technologists, we call upon the NHSX leadership and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to ensure new technologies used in the suppression of Coronavirus follow ethical best practice"</p>

<h2>COVID-19 and AI: A Virtual Conference</h2>
<p>Topics to be addressed include: AI applications in diagnostics and treatment, epidemiological tracking and forecasting of the spread of the virus, information and disinformation, and the broader human impact of COVID-19 and pandemics in general on economies, culture, government, and human behavior. Through timely, insightful presentations and interactive sessions, this event will serve to unite a global community toward solutions to benefit all of humanity.</p>

<h2>Data, Privacy, and the Individual</h2>
<p>"The aim of the research project Data, Privacy, and the Individual is to contribute to a better understanding of the ethics of privacy and of differential privacy. The outcomes of the project are seven research papers on privacy, a survey, and this final report, which summarises each research paper, and goes on to offer a set of reflections and recommendations to implement best practices regarding privacy."</p>

<h2>Algorithmic systems: the consent is in the detail?</h2>
<p>Applications of algorithmically informed decisions are becoming entrenched in society, with data processing being their main process and ingredient. While these applications are progressively gaining momentum, established data protection and privacy rules have struggled to incorporate the particularities of data-intensive information societies. It is a truism to point out the resulting misalignment between algorithmic processing of personal data and the data protection regulatory frameworks that strive for meaningful control over personal data. However, the challenges to the (traditional) role and concept of consent are particularly manifest. This article examines the transformation of consent models in order to assess how the concept and the applied models of consent can be reconciled in order to correspond not only to the current regulatory landscapes but also to the exponential growth of algorithmic processing technologies.</p>

<h2>The Israeli Emergency Regulations for Location Tracking of Coronavirus Carriers</h2>
<p>Surveillance and big data are an area of tech ethics that doesn't always overlap with AI ethics, but this is a reminder of the huge amount of data that we create, and that is retained, which AI might use for unexpected purposes down the road. </p>
<p>"The ISA Emergency Coronavirus Regulations (“Authorizing the Israel Security Agency to Assist in the National Efforts to Reduce the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus”) authorize the ISA to receive, collect and process “technological data” for the purpose of assisting the Ministry of Health in conducting epidemiological investigations to reduce and prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The data should be used to identify the location data and movement routes of coronavirus carriers in the 14 days preceding their diagnosis as carriers, along with the identity of individuals who came into close contact with them."</p>

<h2>The Soap Box as a Black Box: Regulating transparency in social media recommender systems</h2>
<p>"Social media recommender systems play a central role in determining what content is seen online, and what remains hidden. As a point of control for media governance, they are subject to intense controversy and, increasingly, regulation by European policymakers. A recurring theme in such efforts is transparency, but this is an ambiguous concept that can be implemented in various ways depending on the types of accountability one envisages. This paper maps and critiques the various efforts at regulating social media recommendation transparency in Europe, and the types of accountability they pursue."</p>

<h2>How can we build child-friendly AI that empowers children in Africa?</h2>
<p>We missed this last week!</p>
<p>"These reflections were gathered at an AI and Children African regional consultation that took place in Cape Town, South Africa in February 2020. It is the third in a series of regional workshops designed to develop global AI policy guidance that protects child rights."</p>

<h2>We still need responsible tech for care in a global pandemic</h2>
<p>"We spent the last eighteen months researching and redesigning care systems with people on the front line of care – people who give care, who work in care, who receive care, who organise care and who fight for better care, and those who do several or even all of the above. </p>
<p>We came up with three key principles that were necessary prerequisites for technology developed for care to be responsible"</p>
