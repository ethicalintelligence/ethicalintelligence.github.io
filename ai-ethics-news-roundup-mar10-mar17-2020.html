    <p>Welcome to the EI weekly round-up; a curation of quality posts to help you cut through the noise and get right to the heart of the discussion on AI and Tech Ethics.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday we publish a list of links to articles and debates that have happened over the past week in the community, allowing you to stay as up-to-date as possible on developments and facts. We will often link to arguments from all sides of the debate, even if the opinions may be controversial. We would like to mention, however, that EI does not endorse any of the information published, all links are reflections of the author's opinions and not that of Ethical Intelligence.</p>
<h2>How Artificial Intelligence is Aiding the Fight Against Coronavirus</h2>
<p>"The coronavirus (COVID-19) has dominated the global news and resulted in travel restrictions, school closures, market panic, and many more disruptions as health organizations work to contain the spread of the virus. With over 125,000 confirmed cases and over 4,500 deaths worldwide and over 1,600 cases and 41 deaths in the U.S., and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially labeling the virus as a pandemic, the global health community is relying on new tools and technologies to stay ahead. Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven especially valuable every step of the way, from detecting the first coronavirus outbreak to measuring the disease’s economic impact."</p>

<h2>Bias In Recruitment Software To Be ‘Illegal’ in New York, Vendors Will Need Bias Audit</h2>
<p>"A new law by New York’s City Council will in effect make algorithmic bias in recruitment software illegal. It demands that vendors of such candidate filtering tools submit to a bias audit, with Civil penalties for those who fail to conduct an ‘impartial evaluation‘. "</p>

<h2>The emergence of the professional AI risk manager</h2>
<p>"We are now beset by data breaches and data privacy scandals, and regulators around the world have responded with data regulations. GDPR is the current role model, but I expect a global group of regulators to expand the rules to cover AI more broadly and set the standard on how to manage it. The UK ICO just released a draft but detailed guide on auditing AI. The EU is developing one as well. Interestingly, their approach is very similar to that of the Basel standards: specific AI risks should be explicitly managed. This will lead to the emergence of professional AI risk managers."</p>

<h2>AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology</h2>
<p>"A clear alternative to “AI” is to focus on the people present in the system. If a program is able to distinguish cats from dogs, don’t talk about how a machine is learning to see. Instead talk about how people contributed examples in order to define the visual qualities distinguishing “cats” from “dogs” in a rigorous way for the first time. There's always a second way to conceive of any situation in which AI is purported. This matters, because the AI way of thinking can distract from the responsibility of humans."</p>

<h2>Formal GDPR complaint against Google’s internal data free-for-all</h2>
<p>Brave has filed a formal GDPR complaint against Google for infringing the GDPR “purpose limitation” principle. Enforcement would be tantamount to a functional separation of Google’s business. </p>

<h2>Responsible AI Moves Into Focus at Microsoft's Data Science and Law Forum</h2>

<h2>An AI Ethics Checklist for COVID-19 Healthcare Technology</h2>
<p>"On March 13th Forbes published an article entitled <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/03/13/coronavirus-how-artificial-intelligence-data-science-and-technology-is-used-to-fight-the-pandemic/#43242df45f5f">Coronavirus: How Artificial Intelligence, Data Science And Technology Is Used To Fight The Pandemic</a> written by Bernard Marr. In this article Marr lists 10 ways in which AI, ML, and DS are being used to address the pandemic. I would like to use Marr’s list as a framework to propose questions (3 questions per item) that folks designing and using this tech to engage with the virus might ask themselves to better ensure ethical creation and application. You can think of it as an AI ethics checklist"</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence and Future of National Security</h2>
<p>"...Is AI likely to be all it’s cracked up to be? We think the answer is complex and that a modest dose of cold water should be thrown on the subject. In fact, many of the AI systems being envisioned today will take decades to develop. Moreover, AI is often being confused with things it is not. Precision about the concept will be essential if we are to have intelligent discussions about how to research, develop, and regulate AI in the years ahead."</p>

<h2>The Automated Administrative State: A Crisis of Legitimacy</h2>
<p>We missed this last week... </p>
<p>"In recent decades, state and federal agencies have embraced a novel mode of operation: automation. Agencies rely more and more on software and algorithms in carrying out their delegated responsibilities. The automated administrative state, however, is demonstrably riddled with concerns. Legal challenges regarding the denial of benefits and rights—from travel to disability—have revealed a pernicious pattern of bizarre and unintelligible outcomes."</p>

<h2>Artificial intelligence isn’t as smart as it thinks</h2>
<p>"...the technology is limited to narrow tasks that require human oversight and mountains of data which is often skewed in ways that lead to unexpected, or even biased, results. The holy grail — so-called general artificial intelligence that can flit between various jobs mimicking human behavior — is still more a myth than a reality, with more than half of almost 400 AI experts recently surveyed saying it will be at least 2060, if not later, for such technology to become feasible."</p>
