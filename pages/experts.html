                        Amanda is a fourth-year PhD student who works with Professor Verena Rieser on detection and mitigation of abuse in social dialogue systems. Amanda believes AI development and design decisions should take a society-first approach, working towards a Hippocratic oath for AI with clearly defined ethical standards that researchers and developers should uphold. Amanda led her university’s team in the 2018 Amazon Alexa Challenge during which they were finalists out of over 200 applicants and 8 competing universities, and is a committee member of SigGen (Special Interest Group in Natural Language Generation). Amanda holds a Bachelors in Computer Science from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.

                        <br>
                        Alessandra is a keen philosopher, holding an MA (Hons) in Philosophy and an MSc in Mind, Language and Embodied Cognition from the University of Edinburgh. During her studies she developed an interest in the ethics of AI, data and technology - particularly the intersection between human (and perhaps robot?) rights, technology and the law. Her undergraduate thesis was titled 'The Moral Risks of Being too Liberal with Personhood: Discounting AI Systems from the Moral Constituency', whilst her master's project focused on 'Live Facial Recognition Technology: Privacy Invasion or a Safer Nation? An Examination of the Changing Concept of Privacy in the Digital Age.' Alessandra worked with Ethical Intelligence Ltd. as an intern during their 2019 summer programme on the Data for Children Collaborative with UNICEF project. After the internship, she was offered a job with the Collaborative and now works to help (amongst other things) review, test and finalise the ethical protocol and charter that they use for their projects. Her goal is to promote ethics as more than just a tick-box exercise, particularly in the workplace. By building on philosophical decision-making that happens organically, she hopes to encourage more thoughtful, and not forceful, ethical practice across different sectors.

                        <strong>Woodley Brown</strong> 
                        


                        <br>
                        Woodley is an inspired philosopher with an entrepreneurial spirit. His philosophical areas of interest include, but are not strictly limited to: metaphysics, philosophy of mind and cognition, epistemology, and, meta-ethics. He believes that although generalized intelligence research and narrow AI industry has the potential to elucidate human consciousness by simulating it, it is eminently important to preempt and mitigate its deleterious externalities; both by way of policy and through raising awareness. As an accomplished student and teacher, Woodley has worked as a Teaching Assistant at Hampshire College, and has also taught philosophy to primary school children. Later, he wrote a complex thesis on the role of cognitive attention modulation in long-term meditators, as well as helped to establish the University of Edinburgh’s Beneficial AI Society alongside Olivia Gamblin, CEO of Ethical Intelligence Limited. In his spare time, Woodley is a trained meditation teacher, martial artist, scuba rescue diver, and, computer programmer. He is proficient in JavaScript and C++, which makes it easier for him to comprehend the technicalities the Expert network deals with on multiple levels. He holds a BA in philosophy of mind from Hampshire College and a MSc in Mind, Language and Embodied Cognition from the University of Edinburgh.
