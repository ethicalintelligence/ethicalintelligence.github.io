                        <br>
                        Alessandra is a keen philosopher, holding an MA (Hons) in Philosophy and an MSc in Mind, Language and Embodied Cognition from the University of Edinburgh. During her studies she developed an interest in the ethics of AI, data and technology - particularly the intersection between human (and perhaps robot?) rights, technology and the law. Her undergraduate thesis was titled 'The Moral Risks of Being too Liberal with Personhood: Discounting AI Systems from the Moral Constituency', whilst her master's project focused on 'Live Facial Recognition Technology: Privacy Invasion or a Safer Nation? An Examination of the Changing Concept of Privacy in the Digital Age.' Alessandra worked with Ethical Intelligence Ltd. as an intern during their 2019 summer programme on the Data for Children Collaborative with UNICEF project. After the internship, she was offered a job with the Collaborative and now works to help (amongst other things) review, test and finalise the ethical protocol and charter that they use for their projects. Her goal is to promote ethics as more than just a tick-box exercise, particularly in the workplace. By building on philosophical decision-making that happens organically, she hopes to encourage more thoughtful, and not forceful, ethical practice across different sectors.

                        <strong>Woodley Brown</strong> 
                        


                        <br>
                        Woodley is an inspired philosopher with an entrepreneurial spirit. His philosophical areas of interest include, but are not strictly limited to: metaphysics, philosophy of mind and cognition, epistemology, and, meta-ethics. He believes that although generalized intelligence research and narrow AI industry has the potential to elucidate human consciousness by simulating it, it is eminently important to preempt and mitigate its deleterious externalities; both by way of policy and through raising awareness. As an accomplished student and teacher, Woodley has worked as a Teaching Assistant at Hampshire College, and has also taught philosophy to primary school children. Later, he wrote a complex thesis on the role of cognitive attention modulation in long-term meditators, as well as helped to establish the University of Edinburgh’s Beneficial AI Society alongside Olivia Gamblin, CEO of Ethical Intelligence Limited. In his spare time, Woodley is a trained meditation teacher, martial artist, scuba rescue diver, and, computer programmer. He is proficient in JavaScript and C++, which makes it easier for him to comprehend the technicalities the Expert network deals with on multiple levels. He holds a BA in philosophy of mind from Hampshire College and a MSc in Mind, Language and Embodied Cognition from the University of Edinburgh.

                        Alba Curry is a PhD candidate whose research the value of anger and its relevance to contemporary society. Responding to a gap in the conversation about the significance of emotions to ethics, Alba argues that the study of emotion offers invaluable insight to the society-first approach to AI. The study of emotion and AI prompts questions such as whether AI should express emotions and what our own feelings towards AI tell us about what matters to us. Alba is an expertly trained ethical comparativist with a focus on China, Japan and East-West relations in ancient and contemporary contexts. Alba holds an MA in Chinese philosophy from Fudan University in Shanghai, and a Bachelors in Philosophy and Digital Humanities from the University of Glasgow.

                        <strong>Henry Potter</strong> 
        
                        <br>
                        Henry is a cybersecurity researcher at the independent digital rights group Top10VPN, focusing on the technical aspects of online privacy, digital security and government censorship. 
                        Henry is passionate about promoting internet freedom and simplifying these, often complex, topics so that people can be informed about their digital rights and learn how to protect their privacy online.
                        With the rapid rise of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, Henry worries that ethical considerations have too often fallen by the wayside. He truly believes that we need a more considered, transparent, and ethically-minded approach to AI if we are to avoid some serious socio-political dangers.
                        Henry brings a wealth of interdisciplinary experience to a problem that requires an interdisciplinary solution. He recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a MSc in Embodied Cognitive Science and Philosophy of Mind, where he explored the intersections of Philosophy, AI and Neuroscience. Henry is particularly interested in models of cognition that centre around the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis and investigating whether these can tell us anything about the mystery of consciousness. 
                        Henry also holds a Bachelor’s degree from University College London (UCL) in Linguistics, where he specialised in the language impairments associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

                        <br>
                        Katherine Bassil is a neuroscientist and neuroethicist who works with different stakeholders to investigate the ethical and societal implications of neuroscience research and neurotechnology. Katherine firmly believes that neuroethics is needed now more than ever, and without neuroethics responsible brain research and innovation can not be guaranteed. She acknowledges the benefits that new technologies bring but is very cautious of the pitfalls that they might create. This is why she thrives to assist companies and institutions in building technologies that are transparent, beneficial, and ethical. Katherine has worked with several international organisations including Neuroethics Canada, International Neuroethics Society, Società Italiana di Neuroetica (SINe), Bioética Clínica y Neuroética Anáhuac (BINCA) and UNESCO Chair in Bioethics and Human Rights. Katherine holds a MSc in Fundamental Neuroscience from Maastricht University, her dissertation focused on the use of stem cell technology to model brain disorders, and a BSc in Biology with a minor in Psychology from the Lebanese American University. She was also awarded an entry scholarship by the Global Classroom Lebanese American University Model United Nations (GC LAU MUN) program. Currently she is a PhD candidate at Maastricht University, investigating biomarkers for psychiatric disorders and their ethical implications.

                        <strong>Fabio Tollon</strong> 
        
                        <br>
                        Fabio believes that the development of AI will fundamentally change our moral landscape, both in terms of the number of action schemes available to us, and the potential implications of our actions. It is therefore essential that we have a robust meta-ethical grounding in our approach to the ethics of AI. Without rigorous conceptual apparatus we will be lost in our ethical analysis of these emergent and ubiquitous artificial systems. 

                        Fabio is currently part of the research training group GRK 2073 "Integrating Ethics and Epistemology of Scientific Research", funded by the German Research Foundation. His research focuses on the the potential for artificial systems to be moral agents and/or moral patients, and what this could mean for scientists developing and using such systems.
                        
                        Fabio has a BA PPE (politics, philosophy and economics), and an MA (philosophy, cum laude), both from Stellenbosch University.                        <br>
