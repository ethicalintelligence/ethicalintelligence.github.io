                    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                    <p>We believe that integrating the grey area of Ethics into the black and white field of AI, in a way that’s both meaningful and responsive to business and technical goals, requires an interdisciplinary approach. This difficulty of integration can only be solved if we bring together our expertise as philosophers and programmers alike so that we may fully understand the intricacy of the situation and provide clear and creative analysis. Only then can we translate the knowledge of academia into practical application for industry, inspiring and enabling responsible technology for a better tomorrow.  </p>
