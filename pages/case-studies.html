                                <p class="feature">The EI Summer Programme 2019 brought together eighteen postgraduates from various fields of research into three hand-selected interdisciplinary teams during the months of June and July for The Data for Children Collaborative - a Scottish Government and UNICEF entity, Franklin Templeton Investments, and the University of Edinburgh’s IoT department. Each week the teams would meet onsite with the client to participate in discussions over the research collected and material created from the week prior. The teams and weekly meetings were led by EI’s founders with the purpose of developing bespoke solutions such as charters, protocols, and assessments as per the clients’ needs. All three pilot projects were successfully delivered during the final week of July 2019.  </p>
