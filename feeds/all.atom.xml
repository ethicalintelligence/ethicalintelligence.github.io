&lt;h2&gt;The historical trajectories of algorithmic techniques: an interview with Bernhard Rieder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this interview, Michael Stevenson (MS) and Anne Helmond (AH) talk to Bernhard Rieder (BR) about his forthcoming book entitled Engines of Order: A Mechanology of Algorithmic Techniques (University of Amsterdam Press, 2020). In particular, Rieder discusses how the practice of software-making is “constantly faced with the ‘legacies’ of previous work” and how the past continues to operate into present algorithmic techniques."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We know ethics should inform AI. But which ethics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical standards for assessing AI and its associated technologies are still in their infancy. Companies need to initiate internal discussion as well as external debate with their key stakeholders about how to avoid being caught up in difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;

A comparison of the CCPA and GDPR&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the California Consumer Privacy Act, why now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ccpa-info.com/california-consumer-privacy-act-full-text/"&gt;California’s CCPA&lt;/a&gt; came into force January 1st 2020, becoming fully enforceable penalties and all, July 1st 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act has been endearingly referred to as &lt;em&gt;GDPR Lite&lt;/em&gt;, a more laid-back version of the GDPR that could be passed through California’s legislative process with more minimal protest from stakeholders. The CCPA applies against a backdrop of diverse businesses processing personal data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of getting a piece of the new “sharing economy,” countless businesses have cropped up across California which capitalise on the opportunity to cut out the middle-men of their industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business models in the sharing economy bring goods and services directly to consumers, without the stress and liability of managing the aforementioned goods or services themselves. Think Airbnb, which is known as the “The world’s largest hotel which owns no property.” Or Uber, which is the largest ride-sharing service in the world, yet owns no cars and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261755/uber-driver-classification-lawsuit-settlement-20-million"&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt;) employs no drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies participating in the sharing economy rely on data-driven methodologies to maintain healthy profit margins. Facebook can afford to provide you with a “free” service because they profit from the data you generate while engaging with their services. FB’s overall value increases as you post content. California’s Silicon Valley culture has sent a resounding message – &lt;em&gt;data is the gift that keeps on giving&lt;/em&gt;. With a sea of new start-ups relying on data to bolster fragile business models, it’s no wonder that the first US state to enact its own privacy legislation is California. The privacy risk consumers face has increased exponentially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;59%&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;of companies believe that data and data analytics are vital to their organisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;29%&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;of businesses surveyed believed the “big data” allowed them to generate new revenue from existing products or services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://eiuperspectives.economist.com/technology-innovation/business-data-0"&gt; The Economist, The Business of Data, Intelligence Report, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The dangers of the digital economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most digital consumers are wary the moment they input a credit card or phone number online, they may not be aware of the technicalities of data processing, understand nuances of the legal framework, or be familiar with technical terms like “shadow profiling.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shadow profile is made up of data harvested from a multitude of sources, collected as you engage with websites, apps and other digital services. Data is combined by linking matching data points. Accurate estimates can then be made about who you are – your gender, health, interests, socio-economic status, and even your criminal background may be accurately determined.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also surrounded by a multitude of sensors day-to-day that may be collecting data. Your phone, personal assistant, discounted TV nabbed in the Black Friday sale, and even your refrigerator or vacuum cleaner may contain sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of loss of personal data have devastating effects, including, as &lt;a href="https://www.eclypses.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CCPA_Regulations-SRIA-DOF.pdf"&gt;California’s DOJ remarks&lt;/a&gt; “financial fraud, identity theft, unnecessary costs to personal time and finances… reputational damage, emotional stress, and even potential physical harm.” The DOJ also cited that there is a pressing need for enhanced consumer privacy rights, as “neither state nor federal law have kept pace with these [technological] developments in ways that enable consumers to exert control over the collection, use, and protection of their personal information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest concerns for consumers is how to prevent data from being sold to and used in unpredictable ways by third, fourth, and fifth parties, as it’s sold on ad infinitum. Chances are, if you are not paying a subscription for your software-heavy product, your data is being used to fill the profit-gaps. The CCPA is intended to provide traceability for this very reason.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/ccpa-isor-appendices.pdf"&gt;statement of reasons&lt;/a&gt; for the CCPA, the California legislature notes that “although California has been a leader in privacy protection, the law has not kept pace with rapid technological developments and the proliferation of personal information that fuels the internet economy. As a result, consumers are largely unable to control or even understand the collection and use of their personal information by a myriad of businesses and organizations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t the CCPA just another GDPR? Think again...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intention of the CCPA echoes that of the GDPR. The GDPR states in its preamble that “[technological] developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union...natural persons should have control of their own personal data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do the rights granted to consumers in the GDPR compare to those under the CCPA? 
On the face of it, the rights granted to California’s consumers mirror those enumerated in the GDPR. The CCPA also includes the right to be informed about what data is being collected, the right to be informed about how and why your personal data is being used and sold, the right to request deletion of your data, the right to request that companies do not sell personal data, and protections for consumers against discrimination for exercising these rights among other rights. &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121"&gt;You can read the full act here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other similarities. The European Data Protection Supervisory (or EDPS) has remarked that access to a service must not be made conditional upon the individual being forced to ‘consent’ to being tracked and prevents discrimination. Both the GDPR and CCPA explicitly prohibit discriminatory practices against consumers who choose to exercise their privacy rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: 18px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;However, being compliant with the GDPR does not mean you are automatically compliant with the CCPA. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to July of this year, businesses will need to prepare on the ground by, for example, reviewing their site designs and updating their records of data processing. Consumers who expect the CCPA to protect them to the same degree as the GDPR will need to manage high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCPA is much more narrow in scope than the GDPR, excluding certain types of data such as health information, information related to vehicles, or information related to credit worthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the CCPA applies only to businesses that meet certain thresholds – the most notable being that 50% or more of a business’ revenue must be derived from selling personal information. &lt;em&gt;“Selling” data doesn’t just cover cash in exchange for data, but is wide enough to cover other processes deriving value from data.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the GDPR, which is more free-form in its requirements as to how businesses establish opt-in consent (e.g. opt-ins can be a tick-box, or an “I agree” button), the &lt;em&gt;CCPA requires that all websites have a link or logo reading “do not sell my personal information.”&lt;/em&gt; This logo may look jarring to consumers, as it makes it obvious that websites are selling consumer data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The culture of privacy; is data privacy the same in the USA as in Europe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU and USA have markedly different privacy cultures. &lt;a href="https://www.asser.nl/asserpress/books/?rId=12915"&gt;Experts argue&lt;/a&gt; that the EU relies more heavily on written laws to set privacy standards, the legislature pushing specific risk-management rules down onto businesses who view privacy compliance as a legal jargon, an administrative burden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, and “particularly in the United States, there is a surprising deep chasm between privacy law in the books and privacy practice on the ground…the focus is on a reputation-based approach.” In the US, privacy is more closely related to corporate responsibility than litigious risk-management. Regulators push the onus of responsibility onto businesses to determine and drive the appropriate privacy protections within their organizations.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be further demonstrated via the “data as a commodity” argument, which is gaining steam in the USA. This is the idea that data should be viewed as an asset you own and license others to use. Prohibited in earlier versions of the act, the CCPA allows &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/ccpa-isor-appendices.pdf"&gt;financial incentives or price differentials to compensate&lt;/a&gt; for profit gaps. If a consumer doesn’t want to consent to having their data used, they can just pay money to avoid compromising their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How American business empires were built on consumer data and loose terms of privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment model is currently being marketed as a potential legal “solution” for businesses who have built fragile business models that mostly rely on data to generate profit. A great example of a business with such a model is Google. Google offers a free service directly to the consumer – you can Google something, use services like Gmail, Google Maps and Google docs without a monetary charge. Their business model is fragile because it relies on data, and without data there is no business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can afford to stay on the forefront of technological development, have brick-and-mortar locations globally employing thousands of people, and provide consumers with top-tier services and ongoing support by using the data they collect from you. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/"&gt;85% of Google’s revenue&lt;/a&gt; came from ads. Let’s look at targeted ads as an example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted ads work by collecting, analyzing, and processing consumer data. This data processing is used to generate ads that are relevant to you. Data may be disclosed or sold to third parties. If the legal privacy landscape changes significantly, prohibiting Google from using and selling personal data as it can be done today, the business model collapses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of what would happen if the tide were to turn in favor of stronger privacy regulation can be demonstrated by the recent senatorial hearings with Facebook, following the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica data scandal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hearings, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/"&gt;Senator Grassley asked Mark Zuckerburg&lt;/a&gt; “Are you actually considering having Facebook users pay for you not to use the information?” He replied “I think what Sheryl &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-hints-at-possibility-of-paid-service-1523399467"&gt;Facebook’s COO&lt;/a&gt; was saying was that, in order to not run ads at all, we would still need some sort of business model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerburg stated that FB’s business model would fall apart if the company was prohibited from running ads. He implied that the burden of making up the loss in profits could go to consumers, perhaps by FB’s adopting of a “data as a commodity” approach.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What snail beer can teach us about the ethical obligations of data processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine Grassley admired the &lt;em&gt;chutzpah&lt;/em&gt; – no other industry would have the tenacity to argue such a point. On the face of it, it seems like a reasonable business solution. But let’s put it in the context of consumer protection law in food standards, from one of the best-known Scots law cases – &lt;a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html"&gt;Donaghue vs Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Donaghue was treated to a ginger-beer by her friend in Wellmeadow Café in Paisley, one afternoon in 1928. Much to the horror of everyone involved, a lone decomposed snail was found at the bottom of her beer, eventually resulting in Donaghue’s hospitalization from gastroenteritis and shock. The case was fundamentally about negligence, as calculable harm was caused to Mrs. Donaghue. Donaghue vs Stevenson set off a chain-reaction that eventually resulted in the modern concept of “duty of care” toward consumers.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say the “&lt;em&gt;ode-d’escargot&lt;/em&gt;” ginger-beer represents Facebook processing data negligently, such as selling data to third parties like Cambridge Analytica without appropriate controls. Mrs. Donaghue represents the consumer, harmed by the detrimental data processing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalent would be like if the drinks manufacturer, Mr. “Facebook” Stevenson, built his entire business model on the continuous sale of snail beer, maintaining a predilection for not telling his customers about the snails. Imagine if Stevenson testified in court that “snails” were his thing, and not only was he not prepared to stop selling snail beer, but henceforth intended to charge all of his customers who didn’t want a snail in their ginger beer extra for the privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, how else was he going to pay to keep the Café doors open after &lt;em&gt;all of this negative press&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CCPA: A step in the right direction, but not a complete solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propositions for a payment model have raised a number of &lt;a href="https://www.eclypses.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CCPA_Regulations-SRIA-DOF.pdf"&gt;equity concerns&lt;/a&gt; for the DOJ, as “low-income groups may be more likely to give up their personal information in exchange for services while high-income groups will pay the service fee to protect their data.” Big data is arguing for “&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2018/07/07/data-workers-of-the-world-unite"&gt;Technofeudalism&lt;/a&gt;.” To continue with Facebook as the provocative example…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook represents the crown: the technology creator and controller. Since Facebook determines access to, use of and service conditions for their platform, they also represent the nobility in this example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FB users upload their own content to the platform, a process which NY times bestseller &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=634"&gt;Nicholas Carr&lt;/a&gt; cleverly named “digital sharecropping.” Creating content increases the value of Facebook overtime– generating profits for the company that consumers will never see. Ultimately, consumers pay for access to the platform with their data (and maybe in the future, with cash or check too). The consumer ultimately represents the peasantry, and always gets the short-end of the stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If differential pricing models become an industry standard, the CCPA could unintentionally contribute to a ‘privacy class system,’ where higher socio-economic groups are able to pay to protect their personal information and disadvantaged groups have no choice but to allow their data to be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, these services are so engrained into our education system, jobs, and daily lives that any move to regulate them has to navigate the complex short and long-term consequences diligently. Some of these technologies are so pervasive that to not have access to them puts consumers at a measurable social or financial disadvantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the CCPA is a step toward greater transparency and moves some power back into the hands of the consumer, there is still work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, terms and conditions may change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category><category term="ethics"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekly AI Ethics News Roundup: Feb 5 - Feb 11</title><link href="/ai-ethics-news-roundup-feb5-feb11-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-11T09:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-11T09:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>EI-Team</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-11:/ai-ethics-news-roundup-feb5-feb11-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;@alexsablay and @hjegou on tracking training data, @dorotheabaur on facial recognition, @lindakinstler on tech ethicists, @benzevenbergen and @drzimmermann on ethical pitfalls, SyRI from @SaschaSchendel, @datainnovation 2019 review, @PublicStandards report on AI&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;European parliament says it will not use facial recognition tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using ‘radioactive data’ to detect if a data set was used for training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have developed a new technique to mark the images in a data set so that researchers can determine whether a particular machine learning model has been trained using those images. This can help researchers and engineers to keep track of which data set was used to train a model so they can better understand how various data sets affect the performance of different neural networks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Opposing facial recognition — why focusing on accuracy misses the point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These are important and very worrying findings that emphasize the overall problem with algorithmic discrimination. But what does it imply when we argue against facial technology based on empirical arguments such as overall low accuracy and particular bias with regards to certain ethnic groups? In the worst case, proponents of facial recognition could use this argument to their advantage and take it to underline the need to train the technology better to make sure it improves its accuracy — as apparently done by Google last year. Better training means collecting more data. And collecting more data often means intruding into people’s privacy. We might open the floodgates for even larger scale data collection."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ethicists were hired to save tech’s soul. Will anyone let them?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While some tech firms have taken concrete steps to insert ethical thinking into their processes, Catherine Miller, interim CEO of the ethical consultancy Doteveryone, says there's also been a lot of "flapping round" the subject."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Critics dismiss it as "ethics-washing," the practice of merely kowtowing in the direction of moral values in order to stave off government regulation and media criticism. The term belongs to the growing lexicon around technology ethics, or "tethics," an abbreviation that began as satire on the TV show "Silicon Valley," but has since crossed over into occasionally earnest usage.

&lt;h2&gt;AIES '20: Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As AI (and associated AI-hype) grows more pervasive in our lives, its impact on society is ever more significant, raising ethical concerns and challenges regarding issues such as privacy, safety and security, surveillance, inequality, data handling and bias, personal agency, power relations, effective modes of regulation, accountability, sanctions, and workforce displacement. Only a multidisciplinary effort can find the best ways to address these concerns, including experts from various disciplines, such as ethics, philosophy, economics, sociology, psychology, law, history, politics, interaction design, informatics, social studies of science and technology, communication and media studies, and political science, as well as those with lived experience in relation to the impacts of AI systems. In order to address these issues in a scientific context, AAAI and ACM joined forces in 2018 to start the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI Ethics: Seven Traps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The question of how to ensure that technological innovation in machine learning and artificial intelligence leads to ethically desirable—or, more minimally, ethically defensible—impacts on society has generated much public debate in recent years. Most of these discussions have been accompanied by a strong sense of urgency: as more and more studies about algorithmic bias have shown, the risk that emerging technologies will not only reflect, but also exacerbate structural injustice in society is significant."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypergiant Industries builds AI systems for enterprises and governments around the world. We were fortunate to have the chance to interview Will Griffin, Hypergiant’s VP of Ethics and Diversity, to talk about the challenges of bringing ethical awareness to the day to day operations of a major AI systems developer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #666;margin-bottom: 30px;padding-bottom 20px;width: 50px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the VP of Ethics and Diversity in AI at Hyper Giant, you have joined a small but growing number of professionals with ‘ethics’ in their title. What led you to taking this position with a growing tech startup?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Co-Founder and CEO, Ben Lamm’s vision of “delivering on the future we were promised”, inspired me. Ben is an uber-successful serial entrepreneur with multiple exits to his credit. I know Hypergiant will be successful and, combined with a heavy emphasis on ethics; we have the potential to re-shape the way technology companies think about their obligations to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going back even before your current position, what aspect of AI Ethics first caught your attention, and how has that shaped your view of technology?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over my career I have primarily worked at the intersection of media and technology (including launching the first original content on the PlayStation Network and the first video on demand channel on cable with Comcast). There was very little industry regulation and the goal was always to be first.  We followed the Silicon Valley mantra of “go fast and break things.” Unfortunately, we have seen the negative impacts of that approach – especially on privacy. Since AI has the capacity to transform society in ways not previously imagined, I feel an obligation to be a part of making sure AI innovation works for the benefit of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What has surprised you most about your work as the VP of Ethics?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been surprised by two things. 1) The amount of emphasis and demands the public and policymakers are now placing on ethics in technology  and 2) the number of technologists willing to admit how little they know about embedding ethics in their workflows and the products they make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI Code of Ethics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper Giant has a heavy emphasis on the use of ethics in AI development, and even has an AI Code of Ethics, which is something rare to see in a tech startup. What led to the decision in the first place to create this code, and what was it like developing it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to create the AI Code of Ethics came from the top, Ben Lamm. I was brought in specifically to ensure that we stay at the forefront of best practices in operationalizing ethics in our AI workflows and educating our team, clients, and partners on the importance of embedding ethical reasoning at every step of the process. Developing our ethical code and framework has been a lot of fun. As part of the process I visit, and vet our approach, with some of the top thought leaders on ethics in AI. Sangeeta Mudnal (Group Project Manager, for Microsoft’s Responsible AI initiative) is on our Board of Advisors and is very helpful. Frank Buytendijk , head of Ethics at Gartner Research is a great sounding board and thought partner. The professors at Stanford’s AI Lab have been gracious in sharing their approach to ethics education with their computer science students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you give an example of a time where you needed to make technical compromises to align with your ethical code?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date our AI uses cases have not caused us to make technical compromises. Instead, we have to make changes to our AI development workflows. In the old days (pre-2019), AI developers would be presented with a business problem and immediately begin crafting a technical solution and the thought of ethics (or compliance) was an afterthought. Now we incorporate ethical reasoning at the outset and it forces the team to create a range of technical solutions to a given problem and choose the solution with the least ethical challenges and most people-centered beneficial outcomes. In the end, it makes the team more creative because we have to think of more solutions to client problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are many accusations that an ethics code only leads to ethics washing, as there is no proof that a company actually follows such a code. How do you ensure that this is not the case with Hyper Giant?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI Code of Ethics has been helpful, but the mindset that created it is the secret sauce. Every company should (and likely will) develop a statement for public relations reasons, but the companies that embed ethical reasoning into their workflows and culture are the ones who will own the future. We have found that becoming well-versed into ethical reasoning has increased our overall creativity and led our product teams to develop more robust AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How has having an AI Code of Ethics helped shape the work HyperGiant is doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boards of Directors and C-suite executives are well-aware of the well-publicized cases of ethical failures in the technology industry. The image of Mark Zuckerberg sitting in front of Congress being taken to task for Facebook’s myriad ethical failures, including billions of dollars in fines, has prompted introspection on the part of senior leaders. This introspection has increased the calls for companies with a well-defined set of values and tangible experience embedding ethics into the products they create. This has increased the number of pitches we have invited into, but more importantly demonstrating ethics has allowed us to expand our scope of work and amount of projects with our current clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you describe an example where it was hard work to help your client’s adjust their expectations so that they would be compatible with your ethics code?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not want to identify a specific client, but I can speak to issues that apply to every client. Embedding ethics into AI development workflows is challenging at first. The first step is getting the CEO and other responsible C-suite executives to mandate compliance with the AI Code of Ethics. The second step is traing the relevant stakeholders in our ethical reasoning model and vetting all proposed use cases through the model. Once clients see the creativity unleashed and the number of technical solutions they are able to create, they began to embrace the model as a value-add to their overall workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethics in Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you believe is the biggest challenge we are facing in AI Ethics?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge is the prevailing Silicon Valley conventional wisdom that ethical mishaps are just the price to be paid for being first (“move fast, break things”). With the prediction that AI leadership will be worth trillions of dollars, it is easy to see why many companies will not want to change their approach to product development and deployment. We view our role as educating the industry on the economic value of ethics in AI and the trust it will create within the marketplace. We believe the trust generated is what will be required to compete and gain market leadership in the AI-driven world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Ethical Intelligence, we are working to change the narrative around AI Ethics from ethics being a blocker in technology to ethics being an asset to long-term innovation. What inspires you about the field of AI Ethics, and what good do you see if doing in the world of AI?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly with Ethical Intelligence’s approach. I am inspired by all of the discussion (and research) in industry, academia, and the media to raise awareness of the importance of ethics in AI. If privacy had this much attention at the early stages of the internet, I believe social media and other platforms would have evolved with many more protections built-in. The growth of AI gives us another chance to get ethics in technology right, and I am excited to be a part of that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anything further you would like to share?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Artificial Intelligence Is Not Ready For The Intricacies Of Radiology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"...while much of the theoretical basis for AI in the practice of radiology is extremely exciting, the reality is that the field has not yet fully embraced it. The most significant issue is that the technology simply isn’t ready, as many of the existing systems have not yet been matured to compute and manage larger data sets or work in more general practice and patient settings, and thus, are not able to perform as promised. Other issues exist on the ethical aspects of AI. Given the sheer volume of data required to both train and perfect these systems, as well as the immense data collection that these systems will engage in once fully mainstream, key stakeholders are raising fair concerns and the call for strict ethical standards to be put into place, simultaneous to the technological development of these systems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From ethics washing to ethics bashing: a view on tech ethics from within moral philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The word 'ethics' is under siege in technology policy circles. Weaponized in support of deregulation, self-regulation or handsoff governance, "ethics" is increasingly identified with technology companies' self-regulatory efforts and with shallow appearances of ethical behavior. So-called "ethics washing" by tech companies is on the rise, prompting criticism and scrutiny from scholars and the tech community at large. In parallel to the growth of ethics washing, its condemnation has led to a tendency to engage in "ethics bashing." This consists in the trivialization of ethics and moral philosophy now understood as discrete tools or pre-formed social structures such as ethics boards, self-governance schemes or stakeholder groups."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Artificial Intelligence, Values and Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This paper looks at philosophical questions that arise in the context of AI alignment. It defends three propositions. First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify 'true' moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment, that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people's moral beliefs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bias in Word Embeddings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Word embeddings are a widely used set of natural language processing techniques that map words to vectors of real numbers. These vectors are used to improve the quality of generative and predictive models. Recent studies demonstrate that word embeddings contain and amplify biases present in data, such as stereotypes and prejudice. In this study, we provide a complete overview of bias in word embeddings."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Road to Artificial Intelligence: An Ethical Minefield&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are a number of ethical dilemmas woven inextricably into the field of Artificial Intelligence, many of which are often overlooked, even within the engineering community. Even the best intentions are often not enough to guarantee solutions free from unintended or undesired results, as humans can accidentally encode biases into AI engines and malicious actors can exploit flaws in models. In the short-term, accountability and transparency on behalf of tech companies is critical, as is vigilance on behalf of consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preparing For AI Ethics And Explainability In 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People distrust artificial intelligence and in some ways this makes  sense.  With the desire to create the best performing AI models, many organizations have prioritized complexity over the concepts of explainability and trust. As the world becomes more dependent on algorithms for making a wide range of decisions, technologies and business leaders will be tasked with explaining how a model selected its outcome. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Everything We Do Tells Something About Our Health - Including Our Taste in Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of our data exhaust is rich enough that it can be used to generate accurate inferences about us in domains unrelated to context of collection. Machine learning analysis of large sets of data about our music listening habits can reveal information about our physical and mental health. This information, if directly present, would be subject to regulatory and ethical norms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A crucial question is: what exactly is health data? Does it comprise the data from medical treatment and investigation, or is it more than that? In his research, Hooghiemstra refers to medical investigations, also mentioning wearables and apps. But where, precisely, is the line between what is and what is not health data?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI – Enabled Innovation, Part 1: Regulatory Intervention &amp;amp; AI in Financial Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of a two-part series on AI in Finance: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Financial services regulators are promoting principles and giving guidance through public statements to set the expectation that firms need to ensure their governance model is fit for purpose when applied to AI enabled innovation. In time, these regulators will become more proactive in asking firms to demonstrate they fully understand their data assets and to explain how that data is exploited and how the associated risk is mitigated when using AI – enabled technologies. Financial services firms should develop a coherent AI strategy now in a way that anticipates how they will answer that question when it inevitably comes."&lt;/p&gt;

Many video interview tools now incorporate some kind of AI screening to generate reports on candidates, a practice which raises several AI ethics and safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new article at the WSJ discusses some of these: &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-job-interviews-will-transform-in-the-next-decade-11578409136"&gt;How Job Interviews Will Transform in the Next Decade&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Human-like robots spark fear in users according to researchers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Japanese researcher Masahiro Mori’s “uncanny valley” theory, which he developed in the 1970s, states that we react positively to robots if they have physical features familiar to us -but they disturb us if they start looking too much like us."&lt;/p&gt;

Twitter recently found itself in the unusual position of receiving criticism for an effort to protect the privacy of user data, by announcing plans to initiate a cull of abandoned accounts on December 11 2019 as part of an effort to comply with EU data privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would miss accounts that had been disused for ages? Quite a few people, it turned out. It wasn’t because lapsed users thought they might start using their accounts again. The accounts most at stake will never tweet again, because they fell silent when their owners died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leaving their thoughts behind on the social network, people had created a presence for themselves that persisted long after death. Twitter suddenly faced objections from people who would visit the preserved thoughts of a departed &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/twitter-said-it-would-delete-unused-accounts-then-it-realized-some-of-them-belong-to-people-we-want-to-remember.html"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50584688"&gt;boyfriend&lt;/a&gt; or other loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a site that promotes itself as the place to go to discover ‘what’s happening in the world and what people are talking about right now’ this came as a surprise. In fact, it highlights one of the significant changes in online culture since use of the Internet became widespread. A decade ago, Friendster was a major social network, but usage declined until the site eventually closed, an event foreshadowed by an article in the satirical publication The Onion, which &lt;a href="https://www.theonion.com/internet-archaeologists-find-ruins-of-friendster-civili-1819594871"&gt;spoofed Friendster&lt;/a&gt; as an archaeological site marking a lost civilisation. Abandoned accounts on a social network aren’t just a liability, they reflect the health of the platform, and can be an undesirable signal that platforms might wish to conceal. It’s very natural for a business to value current and potential customers, and lost customers that might yet be regained, but much less to value those that are deceased. How should a social network value users that can no longer use its product? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read-Only Memorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more of us have started living significant parts of our lives online, however, an increasing amount of the content on social platforms has been created by people who are no longer alive. Because of this, we can all expect to have ‘digital afterlives’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale is remarkable. Take Facebook as an example, which already has a memorialisation feature for deceased users. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951719842540"&gt;Carl Öhman and David Watson project&lt;/a&gt; that billions of Facebook users will have passed away before 2100, by which time ‘the dead may well outnumber the living’. Öhman’s research with Luciano Floridi examines a whole &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-017-9445-2"&gt;digital afterlife industry&lt;/a&gt; dealing with &lt;a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c059841d-a702-4218-8c1b-39ff49dc6c65/download_file?safe_filename=Ohman_Floridi_R1_edited.pdf&amp;amp;file_format=application%252Fpdf&amp;amp;type_of_work=Journal+article"&gt;online remains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firms such as Eterni.me and Replica now offer consumers online chat bots, based on one’s digital footprint, which continue to live on after users die, enabling the bereaved to “stay in touch” with the deceased. This new phenomenon has opened up opportunities for commercial enterprises to monetise the digital afterlife of Internet users. As a consequence the economic interests of these firms are increasingly shaping the presence of the online dead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large part this is about how those still living can be helped to feel better and cope with loss—and that’s no small thing. Technology can honour the past as well as building the future. When London’s underground railway upgraded its automatic announcement system, in the process replacing the old ‘Mind the gap’ recording, it emerged that the actor who made it had left behind a widow who still listened for her husband’s voice at her station. Railway staff worked to digitise and restore the recording, securing emotional succour for one woman and over &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garius/status/1204795961731629058"&gt;forty thousand likes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another form of benefit for those still living can come from the rich historical resource which all these online posters have cumulatively created. Öhman and Watson emphasise this aspect, describing the aggregate contributions of social media users as a form of cultural heritage which is of value both to historians and ‘to future generations as part of their record and self-understanding’. They advocate ‘a multi-stakeholder approach’ to the maintenance of this record: a commercial platform like Facebook has an obvious economic interest in the running of its own services, but other interested parties might include ‘states, NGOs, universities, libraries, museums’ and the like. Historic data might someday be handled like historic buildings, as assets that come with special responsibilities for their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortal Obligations?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that preserving data of this sort benefits the living, however, isn’t to say that we should understand the value of their digital artifacts entirely in relation to the interests of living people’s wants and needs. We may care not only about doing good for the living, but also about doing the rightly respectful thing for the departed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we believe they are departed, though, to either oblivion or an otherworldly afterlife, then we may be perplexed about how we might be able to treat them well or badly: how they could be, in the philosophical jargon, moral patients. Explanations we might give for moral responsibilities towards sentient beings—explanations involving the capacity to suffer, for example—seem doubtfully applicable towards those who have gone to rest in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t that we can’t conceive of how there could be any kind of moral patient besides a living, thinking, feeling being. Some philosophers do believe there are other kinds of moral patient, and quite possibly you do as well: if you care about ‘the environment’ then you care for something that, though it incorporates various kinds of sentient organism, isn’t reducible to any of them. The problem is that the conceptual toolkit I’d use in asking, say, what could be wrong with wantonly destroying a fossilised ammonite isn’t a toolkit one can simply go ahead and apply to things left behind by human beings. We don’t relate to that long-dead organism as we do to a dead person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So questions are explored about what could make dead people, as a class, qualify as moral patients. Is it possible to harm the dead? Do practices like writing and honouring wills imply that obligations towards the dead person who is are disguised duties to the living one who was, or does that merely restate the paradox in another form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Media Absence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter was forced to consider dead people as a class among its account-holders, but that’s because of some users’ very specific connections with particular people they’ve lost: with parents and spouses and lovers and friends, people with names and personal histories. Parts of those individual histories linger online. When we remember people through mementos—a portrait, say—our treatment of the objects expresses attitudes towards the people themselves. If you see a social media profile in this way, like a portrait you’d hang in a place of honour, then the point of view from which it’s obsolete clutter in the database is going to be far from what you can personally endorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Öhman and Floridi suggest that we should literally regard the digital material people leave behind as a form of human remains—‘not merely regarded as a chattel or an estate, but as something constitutive of one’s personhood’—and should draw on archaeological ethics to identify the principles behind respectful display of them. It’s unclear how far existing archaeological ethics will take us towards working out whether anyone has an obligation to fund the ongoing display, however; the Internet has nothing analogous to reburial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some writers on the ethics of heritage and human remains contrast a materialist, empiricist West, which thinks of being dead as being gone, with different societies in which the dead are understood to have an ongoing presence in the life of a community. &lt;a href="http://www.piotrbienkowski.co.uk/"&gt;Piotr Bienkowski&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has written that scepticism about connections with people from former times arises from a view of the world that regards the dead ‘as no longer existing or having personhood in any sense’. If that’s how the West truly thinks, though, then perhaps our technological society is developing so that we start to think differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now common for some of our most significant relationships to take place entirely online. If we encounter people through their online presence while they live to update it, maybe it’s not so strange a notion that something of them remains present while it persists on the servers. We should bear in mind, though, that for many people, their  online personae are not authoritative self-portraitures but often impressionistic or playful takes on themselves, sometimes multiple masques that relate only part of their personalities to specific audiences. We should perhaps be careful about these subtleties when memorializing online self-expression, and not take it more seriously in death than the mind behind it did in life. Nevertheless, even an outright parody account can be fondly regarded as part of a community. It leaves a hole in that community when the posting suddenly ceases, and can retain its place of honour in the ‘social graph’ of friend or follower relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ten years we’ve gone from seeing Friendster’s decline spoofed as an archaeological dig to Öhman and Watson’s serious proposal that Internet hosts are custodians of a form of human cultural heritage. And as stories about bereavement go, Twitter’s experience carries a heartwarming moral: what seemed to be a load of disused data was in fact a memorial to the dead and is actually giving living people reasons to keep coming back to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter was taken aback by the discovery that deceased people can still be part of its community. This is not the only form online remembrance can take—you may even have had a secret memorial sent to you in &lt;a href="https://xclacksoverhead.org/home/about"&gt;HTTP headers&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s a form that underlines how those content posters who’ve passed on can still have significant social and therefore ethical relationships with living people: relationships that matter to those people in ways that foster a deep commitment to keeping them going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital afterlives are a recent and growing source of questions for industry and policy—and Twitter will still be working out how best to square them with EU privacy rules. These are the early stages of working out how to handle personal grief on the public Internet: who shall bear the costs, and when it’s acceptable for the ‘digital afterlife industry’ to explore the opportunities. Will this lead to the involvement of religious bodies, such as the Vatican, when it comes to the preservation of digital afterlives? For tech companies already under the spotlight, approaching these questions with ethical sensitivity will be part of securing their own survival. For regulators and ethicists, this is an important issue that problematises recent approaches to privacy and data rights. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category><category term="ethics"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekly AI Ethics News Roundup: Dec 17-24</title><link href="/ai-ethics-news-roundup-dec17-dec24.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-24T09:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-12-24T09:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>EI-Team</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-12-24:/ai-ethics-news-roundup-dec17-dec24.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Weekly AI Ethics News Roundup: Dec 17 - Dec 24&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the EI weekly round-up; a curation of quality posts to help you cut through the noise and get right to the heart of the discussion on AI and Tech Ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implementing Ethics Into Artificial Intelligence: A Contribution, From A Legal Perspective, To The Development Of An Ai Governance Regime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new article added to a great issue of the Duke Law and Technology Review that came out in August, a &lt;a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dltr/vol18/iss1/"&gt;Symposium for John Perry Barlow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This Article advocates for the need to conduct in-depth risk-benefit-assessments with regard to the use of AI and autonomous systems. This Article points out major concerns in relation to AI and autonomous systems such as likely job losses, causation of damages, lack of transparency, increasing loss of humanity in social relationships, loss of privacy and personal autonomy, potential information biases and the error proneness, and susceptibility to manipulation of AI and autonomous systems.

&lt;p&gt;When things go wrong and AI runs amok, the lawyers will be there to tell us the most company-friendly version of what happened. Most importantly, they’ll protect companies from having to share how their AI systems work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI Index 2019 Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An independent initiative within Stanford University’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institute, the report is in its third year and is the result of a collaborative effort led by the AI Index Steering Committee, an interdisciplinary group of experts from across academia and industry, in collaboration with more than 35 sponsoring partners and data contributors. The purpose of the project is to ground the discussion on AI in data, serving practitioners, industry leaders, policymakers and funders, the general public and the media that informs it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do You Trust Jeff Bezos With Your Life? Tech Giants Like Amazon Are Getting into the Health Care Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you trust the Tech Giants with your health data in exchange for more personalized and on-demand healthcare? This article covers the current initiative of telehealth by Amazon and dives into a few key implications that this new commodity would carry for society at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What health insurance companies, as well as employers who foot the bulk of the U.S.'s health care bill, especially fear from telehealth is that it's so easy to use that people will reach out more often for care. "It creates the risk that every little ache and pain results in a claim that has to be paid out," says the University of Pennsylvania's Asch. "Making people come into the office is health care rationing by inconvenience."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A tug-of-war over biased AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A critical split divides AI reformers. On one side are the bias-fixers, who believe the systems can be purged of prejudice with a bit more math. (Big Tech is largely in this camp.) On the other side are the bias-blockers, who argue that AI has no place at all in some high-stakes decisions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On the Legal Compatibility of Fairness Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the article was on arxiv last week, the author publicized it this week, and it's a good one. There's poor alignment between operationalized definitions of fairness in machine learning and the legal definitions that may in fact apply to the deployment of these systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Past literature has been effective in demonstrating ideological gaps in machine learning (ML) fairness definitions when considering their use in complex socio-technical systems. However, we go further to demonstrate that these definitions often misunderstand the legal concepts from which they purport to be inspired, and consequently inappropriately co-opt legal language. In this paper, we demonstrate examples of this misalignment and discuss the differences in ML terminology and their legal counterparts, as well as what both the legal and ML fairness communities can learn from these tensions. We focus this paper on U.S. anti-discrimination law since the ML fairness research community regularly references terms from this body of law."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical reflection on the problems that arise when the pursuit of good is taken on as a technical objective too hastily, and why sustained and rigorous ethical reflection is a necessary if we want to have any confidence that such efforts will actually succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite widespread enthusiasm among computer scientists to contribute to “socialgood,” the field’s efforts to promote good lack a rigorous foundation in politicsor social change. There is limited discourse regarding what “good” actuallyentails, and instead a reliance on vague notions of what aspects of society aregood or bad. Moreover, the field rarely considers the types of social changethat result from algorithmic interventions, instead following a “greedy algorithm”approach of pursuing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three arguments for the idea that ethics is subjective, presented with thoughtful rebuttals.

&lt;p&gt;When health-related disinformation is available online, who is responsible? There's a growing backlash against the idea of platforms as "mere tools", but perhaps we should think the same of search engines.

think differently about Google?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Datafication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of researching and discussing AI ethics challenges, we might run across the claim while the rate and scope of our generation of data has increased, it can be understood on a continuum with the ways in which human activity have always left traces and records. This article on the concept of "datafication" argues against this, and shows several ways to understand what is distinctive about the new systems and actors that collect and use our data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Datafication is not just the making of information, which, in one sense, human beings have been doing since the creation of symbols and writing. Rather, datafication is a contemporary phenomenon which refers to the quantification of human life through digital information, very often for economic value. This process has major social consequences. Disciplines such as political economy, critical data studies, software studies, legal theory, and—more recently— decolonial theory, have considered different aspects of those consequences to be important. Fundamental to all such approaches is the analysis of the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Second Wave of Algorithmic Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"... the first wave of algorithmic accountability focuses on improving existing systems, a second wave of research has asked whether they should be used at all—and, if so, who gets to govern them".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Pasquale argues that we can distinguish the "... first wave of algorithmic accountability research and activism", which has targeted existing systems and helped illuminate urgent ethical concerns in the AI systems already online, from "...an emerging “second wave” of algorithmic accountability has begun to address more structural concerns.". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Both waves will be essential to ensure a fairer, and more genuinely emancipatory, political economy of technology". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Machine Learning on Encrypted Data Without Decrypting It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Recent breakthroughs in cryptography have made it practical to perform computation on data without ever decrypting it. In our example, the user would send encrypted data (e.g. images) to the cloud API, which would run the machine learning model and then return the encrypted answer. Nowhere was the user data decrypted and in particular the cloud provider does not have access to either the orignal image nor is it able to decrypt the prediction it computed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This application of homomorphic encryption systems might mitigate a number of data protection problems, even though it would still be imperative to ensure the data was collected ethically, and that the data itself is free from biases that are not understood and accounted for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tainted Data Can Teach Algorithms the Wrong Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security problems become ethics problems when vulnerabilities in software systems produce risks in their application that the stakeholders (both users, and the people in the social environment) are unable to understand, assess, and freely and knowingly accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adversarial input is a particularly powerful way to undermine machine learning systems and to cause them to behave in unexpected and unintended ways. "“Current deep-learning systems are very vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and the rush to deploy the technology in the real world is deeply concerning,” says Cristiano Giuffrida, an assistant professor at VU Amsterdam who studies computer security, and who previously discovered a major flaw with Intel chips affecting millions of computers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-019-00354-x"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; Luciano Floridi draws our attention to the extension of the practice of ethics dumping, "the export of unethical research practices to countries where there are weaker legal and ethical frameworks" into the digital realm. This is an ethical risk, but it is also a more basic risk to the quality of research. This article argues that there are also security problems with this sort of practice. "... some companies outsource the training of their AI systems, a practice known as machine learning as a service. This makes it far harder to guarantee that an algorithm has been developed securely."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Reuters reporters in Moscow who typed the name of the Crimean provincial capital Simferopol into Apple’s Maps and Weather apps on Wednesday saw it displayed as “Simferopol, Crimea, Russia”.

&lt;p&gt;One might wonder if the technical specifications in the ticket for the engineering work that was involved discussed the political and ethical implications. It's perhaps difficult to imagine that something of this magnitude wasn't remarked upon, but on the other, so much engineering work in software proceeds as though it happens in at least partial isolation from the downstream social and political environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Through these experiences, I’ve found myself having some of the same conversations over and over, all surrounding the applicability of ethics in the tech industry. There are some persistent misconceptions about both the study of ethics and its application to technical work. In order to help bring clarity to the confusion surrounding ethics in tech, I’m going to briefly discuss three significant misconceptions I've observed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There is one right answer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;(or no right answers, if you take a subjective approach)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethics is the study of right and wrong, so shouldn’t there be a right and wrong answer to every ethical question? If there was, then the ethical dilemmas programers and technologists face would have long been answered by general principles with universal applicability across projects, cultures, and domains. Of course, if this were true, the daily news would not include so many stories involving ethical lapses or miscalculations where technological platforms, tools, and solutions cause serious harms. We are all familiar with the headline stories, self-driving cars making errors that human drivers would not, autonomous weapons systems being developed and deployed by militaries, banks and governments using AI driven gatekeepers to control access to credit and social services, and fintech companies making trading decisions at the speed of light, far faster than humans can intervene. These are all headline worthy examples of tech gone wrong due to ethical lapses. But, when we take a step back from these bigger stories, we also discover the points in which software engineers and technologists are at risk for the same ethical lapses, as they make decisions every day in the course of their work that can have real ethical impacts. ‘Do I use a social sign-on SDK, because it’s faster, even though there are privacy tradeoffs? Do we let a test suite languish to save time? Do we optimize for the biggest curve, even if that means missing important edge cases? Is the dataset we are pre-training an algorithm with fair, and ethically sourced?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem like there are only two possible solutions to these ethical dilemmas. Either we finally discover this elusive single, straightforward, universal guideline that can be applied across the board, or, if that doesn’t exist, then we must throw up our hands in defeat because ethics is too subjective and we will never arrive at an acceptable single answer.  Why is it that these seem to be our only two possible solutions to solving tech ethics problems? Well, we all come from different backgrounds, which in turn shape our understanding of what constitutes right and wrong. Everything from our culture, our education, and our life experiences can potentially influence how we approach ethical problems. Because of this, being aware of, and finding solutions to the ethical dilemmas raised by technology requires careful navigation of the multiple understandings of right and wrong at play. To complicate matters further, ethics is an emotionally charged topic. We are very attached to our personal ethical frameworks, and are hurt when it is threatened or violated. And yet, there are situations in which two people can have opposing ethical frameworks, and still both arrive at what could be considered a right answer in accordance to those individual frameworks.  The combination of this emotional attachment along with the varying ethical frameworks results in the feeling that the right answer to our ethical dilemmas is impossible to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I would argue otherwise, as there are significant overlaps in the ethical frameworks between individuals. This overlap in turn enables us to uncover an understanding of the problems we face and from there make informed decisions. What I'm suggesting is that we don't need to solve the fundamental metaethical dilemmas that philosophers have been arguing about for millennia in order to appreciate and mitigate the ethical risks that technical decisions expose us to. Often an informed ethical awareness is the most significant step towards improving our ability to foresee and to mitigate the ethical risks in our technical practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It is possible to eliminate ethical bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic bias has become a buzzword with a strong negative connotation which results in  often hearing that we need to eliminate bias in our algorithms. However, when it comes to bias in terms of ethical decision making, it is not actually possible to completely eliminate that bias. This is because data is not neutral, it reproduces the biases in the world it comes from, as well as new biases introduced knowingly or accidentally through collection, processing and use. When we try to mitigate bias in data, we must often confront real ethical dilemmas from the world it came from, and make our best efforts to address them. Confronting these dilemmas, or, in other words, attempting to mitigate the biases inherent in the data, involves taking a stance of our own, which is a sort of bias itself. So, in this sense, ethical bias is impossible to fully eliminate, which makes it something we should take on as a serious responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore this. You’re working for a university, collecting simple data on students such as class attendance, grades, library usage, when you’re asked to develop specific insight on student mental health out of this data. You of course know to clean the data and set controls to mitigate any previous biases as a first step. However, in order to move on to creating the algorithm that will allow you to draw insights into the mental health status of students, you must first take a biased stance on ethics. You either have to decide to create an algorithm that will track student mental health with the hopes of providing care and wellbeing for the greatest amount of people, or decide that this would be a violation of respecting the dignity of an individual, and so not create the algorithm.  In other words, your decision between the two equally as important ethical values depends on your own bias towards those values. Since there is no way to honor both values equally in this situation, a decision must be taken by prioritizing one value over the other, and the ethical bias cannot be avoided. It is also important to note that in this example, the ethical dilemma surfaces only after the info from the data is extracted. By extracting this knowledge on the mental status of students, an ethical imperative to help the identified students is created. This all goes to show, collecting knowledge from datasets is not an ethically neutral task. 
Programmers need to be acutely aware of what ethical values are at play and how they are prone to prioritize these values. It's easy to get lost in the weeds solving architectural and implementation problems, but even these ground level decisions can have ethical impacts we must be aware of. Choices of technologies, datasets, integration partners, and problem definitions all expose the ethical edges of technical development. At the macro level, it's important to take a step back, and make sure we have articulated and examined the values that have guided and shape the formulation of business and technical goals, so that the ways these values interface with other values in the world in which our systems are deployed are understood and made clear. It is therefore essential to to build this kind of ethical awareness into organizational culture and technical decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethics is a blocker to innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is ethics someone else's problem? Surely the software’s only responsibility is to is to work, not understand ethics. This is a view I often hear when speaking with programmers, as they express an underlying fear of having constraints placed on their previously unencumbered freedom to develop their technology. Ethics can appear to be a blocker if it is viewed as just another piece of paperwork that needs to be filed or the opportunity for someone from a non-technical background who just doesn’t get ‘it’ to kill an interesting project before it’s had the chance to get off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s another perspective. You can think about tech ethics in much the same way programmers are accustomed to thinking about technical debt. Making short term architectural decisions to meet immediate needs involves taking on a notion of "well, it works" that is dangerously myopic. Most programmers are intimately familiar with the exponential accumulation of technical debt, and the astounding difficulty in mitigating it, when working in an environment that doesn’t value longer term thinking. Ethics is the same way. Tiny shortcuts in seemingly insignificant systems can have real effects on people’s lives. In a recent project we looked at, a contractor working on the logged-out view of a particular web application state left in personally identifying information that could be used to unmask users in ways at risk to be that could be abused into pinpointing places and times they had attended particular events. The contractor satisfied the requirements they were given, the test suite didn’t check this, QA didn’t, and a higher level-commitment to recognizing the failure modes that mishandling the unique data this company held had never been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building in ethical awareness from the ground up is an asset, not a liability. If we go about developing our technology ethically, we are innovating for long-term sustainability, not short-term profit. Whereas, if we “move fast and break things”, without ethical considerations, then it is only a matter of time before consequences arise that are difficult or impossible to unwind. When we break things, people get hurt. There are financial, social, legal, and moral costs involved. Technical innovation needs ethics (and technical advancement likewise allows use to make ethical advances), because at the end of the day, we as humans try to do the right thing, and expect our technology to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category><category term="ethics"></category></entry></feed>
